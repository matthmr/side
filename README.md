# Side projects
Just lil' pointless things, mostly scripts that are too useless to be on [scripts.d](https://github.com/matthmr/scripts) (check it out, by the way).

## tra.sh
For you Windows®©™ peeps who miss the recycle bin from that ***GOD-FORBIDDEN*** operating system.
Also for this to be functional you need to write `tra.sh update` in some file that is read every time the system boots up like `.xinitrc`, `.bashrc`, `/etc/profile`, etc. Else you can manually update it with `tra.sh update`.

## unit
"Unit test" with a shell script. Change `TESTS` to get proper testing.

## ffl
[unit](#unit) integration with [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf).

## orx
[clipmenu](https://github.com/cdown/clipmenu) integration with [xbindkeys](git://git.savannah.nongnu.org/xbindkeys.git/).
This was created because [X11](https://x.org/wiki) clears the clipboard when a window closes. This is **extremely** frustating (although being the intended behaviour) for tiling window manager users such as myself.
### Installation and usage:
- put `orx` into a `$PATH` directory (/usr/local/bin, for example).
- copy the contents of `orx.xbindkeysrc` to `~/.xbindkeysrc`.
- restart the `xbindkeys` daemon.
- `CRTL-ALT-V` to send the copy content to a memory buffer using `xsel`, then `CTRL-V` to paste (duh).

## ffc
[clipmenu](https://github.com/cdown/clipmenu) integration with [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf).
This is intended to execute a command with the cache file generated by clipmenu or with the content of that clip itself.

## ffrr
[grep](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/) integration with [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf).
