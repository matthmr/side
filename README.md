# Side projects
Just lil' pointless things, mostly scripts that are too useless to be on [scripts.d](https://github.com/matthmr/scripts) (check it out, by the way).

## tra.sh
For you Windows®©™ peeps who miss the recycle bin from that ***GOD-FORBIDDEN*** operating system.
Also for this to be functional you need to write `tra.sh update` in some file that is read every time the system boots up like `.xinitrc`, `.bashrc`, `/etc/profile`, etc. Else you can manually update it with `tra.sh update`.

## unit
"Unit test" with a shell script. Change `TESTS` and `EXPECTED` to get proper testing
